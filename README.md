# Path-Finding-Intelligent-Agent
An intelligent agent finds a path to clean a 10X10 grid

A 10 by 10 tiled floor is cleaned by an intelligent vacuum cleaner.
The actuator actions are MR, ML, MU and MD respectively for movements in right, left, up, and down directions.The fifth action is 'Suck the dirt' (S)
and the sixth action is 'Do nothing'(N). The action ‘Do nothing’ is meant to indicate the vacuum cleaner resting action.

While the vacuum cleaner can move in the any one of the four directions one step at a time, its cost is 2 units per step. The dirt is cleaned by the vacuum cleaner by its actuator brush which sucks the dirt completely from the tile at the cost of 1 unit.
The vacuum cleaner cleans the floor and can rest at any one corner of the room
